This is a cross-compatible text editor for different terminals (Windows CMD, Windows Powershell, Linux terminals, etc.) !!!No MAC support.


Download the cpp file and compile it for your machine.


Usage:

"termwrite" - creates new file

"termwrite \<filename\>" - opens a file


In Write Mode, you can type, edit text, etc. (press ESC to switch to Move Mode)

In Move Mode, you can use WASD to navigate around the text document, press Q to exit, press X to save the file or ESC to switch back to write mode.

At the bottom, you find the Info Bar which shows what mode you're in, the row and column you're on and also whether the document is saved or not.

Known Bugs:

1. In Linux, the terminal cursor doesn't show up where it should be, so you have to use the row and column to find out where you are.

Providing you find other bugs, don't hesitate to open a new issue.
